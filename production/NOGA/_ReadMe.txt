Problem:
For proper MiMS testing using the NOGA, team needs a communication method between a controlling system (PC with Python or Robot framework) and the NOGA. This communication should enable precise control and monitoring of the motor rotation speed, frequency, and other relevant parameters.

Solution:
Design and develop a draft for a protocol that utilizes serial communication interface between the PC and the Arduino board. The Arduino board should be connected to the PC via a USB or serial connection, enabling reliable bidirectional data transfer.

The protocol facilitates precise control and monitoring of the motor rotation speed, frequency, and other parameters. It can be specifically designed for simulating CO2 detection and respiration rate in various conditions.
