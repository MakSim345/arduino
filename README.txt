1. Installing libraries

For information on installing libraries, see: "http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries"

Easyest way:
- copy folder with a library to "C:/Program Files (x86)/Arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries"
- open "Sketch->Include Library" and select new library
- it may add the header file to source code.
- restart the Arduino IDE!

=========================================================================================
2. Manual installation of a libraries
- Create a ZIP file with a Librar
- Or download it as a ZIP file, expand it and put in the proper directory.

- Add zip file
- Add a Library


=========================================================================================
To add a library to the Arduino IDE, follow these steps:

1. Download the library from its source, which is typically the Arduino Library Manager or a third-party website. The library should be in a ".zip" format.

2. Open the Arduino IDE.

3. Click on the "Sketch" menu at the top of the IDE, then navigate to "Include Library" > "Add .ZIP Library".

4. Select the ".zip" file of the library you downloaded and click "Open".

5. The library will be added to the IDE and you can now use it in your sketches.

6. To verify that the library was added successfully, you can check the "Sketch" menu again and look for the library under "Include Library". If it appears in the list, it was successfully added.

That's it! You can now use the library in your Arduino sketches by including its header files and calling its functions. If you encounter any issues with the library, make sure to check its documentation or support resources for troubleshooting tips.
