1. Installing libraries

For information on installing libraries, see: "http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries"

Easyest way:
- copy folder with a library to "C:/Program Files (x86)/Arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries"
- open "Sketch->Include Library" and select new library
- it may add the header file to source code.
- restart the Arduino IDE!

Manual installation

When you want to add a library manually, you need to download it as a ZIP file, expand it and put in the proper directory. The ZIP file contains all you need, including usage examples if the author has provided them. The library manager is designed to install this ZIP file automatically as explained in the former chapter, but there are cases where you may want to perform the installation process manually and put the library in the libraries folder of your sketchbook by yourself.

You can find or change the location of your sketchbook folder at "File > Preferences > Sketchbook location."
